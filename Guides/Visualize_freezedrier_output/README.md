Visualizing output from CoolSafe 9L Freeze-dryer
Is not optimized to create pdf according to the number of runs. Have to change manually. Example with 16 runs provided in text.  
In this setup tubes have a height that allows 3 funtioning shelves. Code is easily modifyible to 5 shelves. 

## Introduction 
#### Study headline:
Visualize output from CoolSafe 9L Freeze-dryer https://www.labogene.com/CoolSafe-4-15L-Freeze-Dryers  
Freeze-drying: Primary drying 17h at 0.1hPa and 23 °C. Secondary drying 3h at 0.05hPa and 23 °C.

#### Background:  
In this context it is processing samples from the DCH-NG cohort (Investigations on the interaction between the microbiome, host genetic variation and life style in the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver disease and colorectal cancer) limited to MAX. 
Project F2: MAX samples where individuals have collected fecal samples at multiple time points, N=1319.   
Participant and study information is available in a separate document provided by KB.    
Sample aliquoting is performed from freeze-dried specimens. Sample aliquotation is not feasible using traditional laborious methods such as drilling.   

#### Aim:   
Visualize output, primarily investigate if freeze-drying is performing according to planned by achieving a steady temperature.
